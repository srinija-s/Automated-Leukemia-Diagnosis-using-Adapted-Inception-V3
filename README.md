# Automated-Leukemia-Diagnosis-using-Adapted-Inception-V3
Leukemia, a malignant hematologic disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation of blood cells, poses significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Timely and accurate detection of leukemia subtypes is essential for effective patient management and treatment planning. In this paper, we present a adapted Inception V3 framework tailored for automated leukemia detection from microscopic blood smear images. Our approach integrates advanced deep learning methodologies with modified model architecture to discern between various leukemia subtypes, including Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), and healthy samples. Rigorous preprocessing techniques, including image resizing and normalization, are employed to enhance model performance. Leveraging transfer learning, the Inception V3 model is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing multiple leukemia subtypes. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in 100 \% of training accuracy  and 99.72 \% of testing accuracy.
